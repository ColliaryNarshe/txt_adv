First attempt using pygame. A short text adventure game meant to be highly luck based. Similar to a game of solitare, not all games can be won. At the start, the number of chests, traps, and enemies are randomized. The aim was to make roughly half of the games winable.

Controls: WASD, arrows, ENTER

Simply run main.py to start.
